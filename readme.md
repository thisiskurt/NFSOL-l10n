# NFSOL l10n

A fan-made localization project for the game Need For Speed ONLINE.

## Getting started

### Languages included

**chinese** is the backup of official (Tencent) translation. **Do not modify!!!**

Other folder(s) should contain translation in the language specified by folder names.

### File naming rules

Please specify GMT time-stamp in format of yyyyMMdd in filename.

```
l10n-string-cn_201803301227.json
```

While uploading a translation, add a string of lower-case English letters inclusive or numbers, then specify last edited time in GMT.

```
l10n-string-cn_201803301227_kurt_201803301857.json
```

### Cycle

Normal period -- NFSHelper translation working properly. No actions need to be taken.

Expiration -- NFSHelper no longer displays translation. Needs to update the translation according to **LATEST** ***chinese*** or ***english*** translation.

#### When does *Expiration* happen?

It happens usually when the game receives major update that renders previous localization non-functional due to missing critical strings.

Beware it is **unnecessary** to modify translation files between major game patches.
