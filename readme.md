# NFSOL l10n

A fan-made localization project for the game Need For Speed ONLINE.

## Getting started

### Work flow

Normal -- NFSHelper working properly. No actions need to be taken. Wait.

Expiration -- Previous translation no longer working for NFSHelper. Update the translation according to **LATEST** *chinese* or *english* translation. (This usually occurs when the game gets patched)

### When is an update needed?

Usually when the game receives major update which renders previous localization non-functional.

It is **unnecessary** to modify translation files between major game patches.

### Languages

**chinese** is the backup of official (Tencent) translation. **Do not modify!!!**

Other folder(s) should contain translation in the language specified by folder names.

### File naming rules

Please use GMT/UTC time-stamp in format of yyyyMMdd in filename.

```
l10n-string-cn_201803301227.json
```

To specify the contributor, add a string of lower-case English letters inclusive or numbers.

```
l10n-string-cn_201803301227_kurt_201803301857.json
```
